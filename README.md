# NoteApp
Creating notes and caching data which supports CRUD operations with architecture based on MVVM and clean architecture 



## `𝚆𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚒𝚜 𝚌𝚕𝚎𝚊𝚗 𝚊𝚛𝚌𝚑𝚒𝚝𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎`
* Its a way to organize the project to achieve `maintainability` and `scalability`.
* Having one concern per component -> Meaning each piece of our architecture does only one thing and nothing else. If one component is doing more than one thing, we need to split them 
* It is structured layered dependency. It is not specific to mobile development instead its software development architecture.

## `𝙰𝚍𝚟𝚊𝚗𝚝𝚊𝚐𝚎𝚜 𝚘𝚏 𝚌𝚕𝚎𝚊𝚗 𝚊𝚛𝚌𝚑𝚒𝚝𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎`
* `Strict architecture` so its not easy to make mistakes.
* `Business logic is encapsulated` so its to use and test.
* `Parallel` development.
* `Highly scalable` so we can grow a small project into a large one without bumping into problems.
* `Easy` to understand and maintain.
* `Testing` is facilitated
